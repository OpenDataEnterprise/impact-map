By analyzing existing agricultural datasets from the Ministry of Agriculture, Swandiri engineers identify trends in frequency and location of low crop yields. These datasets are both open and machine-readable, allowing scientists to easily reuse and reproduce results in their experiments. Their drones are then deployed in those regions to take photos of the land to perform analyses.
