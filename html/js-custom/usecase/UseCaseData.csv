Currently, parents seeking more information on where daycare facilities in the city are located and what types of services or specialties they offer are directed to use a search engine maintained by the city of Berlin government. However, this engine is limited in its ability to combine multiple search terms or to filter facilities by the opening or closing times, for example. Moreover, the search results are returned as text, making it difficult to understand where exactly in the city a given facility is located and how convenient it might be for you to reach.<br><br> As an answer to these problems, the Ideation & Prototyping Lab at the Technologiestiftung Berlin developed Kita-Suche (“Daycare search”), an interactive map that displays the locations of all daycare facilities in Berlin. The results displayed can be refined by postal code or by a given radius, as well as by a variety of criteria, such as what kind of instructional approach the facility uses (e.g. Montessori, religion-based, etc.) or what languages the centre offers. <br><br>Currently, Kita-Suche is not able to solve the core challenge facing parents in search of daycare service for their child, which is identifying which centres actually have openings for new children – this information is not regularly transmitted from daycare facilities to the city government, and thus it cannot currently be reliably provided to parents. But, Kita-Suche represents an important initial step toward simplifying the search for daycares in Berlin, and the Technologiestiftung hopes to refine this service as more data is made available with greater regularity.""",Kitasuche_edu_eca.jpg,Europe & Central Asia,NA,May 22 2018,publish,AA,

However, while the majority of the activities in parliament, such as votings, motions, and committees, take place in the open, too often, information is difficult to find, access and use. Created in 2012, Odekro is an online platform that aims to promote transparency and citizen participation in Ghana by providing public access to Bills, Motions, and Parliamentary proceedings (Hansards).<br><br>Mainly, the work of Odekro is to extract the data from different public sources, such as the Parliament of Ghana, the Electoral commission, and Ghana statistical service.

Making this information open allows media organizations to contribute to a more evidence-based public discussion, and increased public accountability of Members of Parliament. An example of this was the attention recently drawn to the country’s non-attending MPs after a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.modernghana.com/news/660880/1/125-mps-risk-losing-seats-for-absenteeism.html"">letter sent by Odekro to the Speaker of Parliament</a> based on this data.
